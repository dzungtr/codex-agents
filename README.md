# codex-agents

A terminal cockpit for running several [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) agents in
parallel. It is *only* a list view — the conversation experience is codex's own TUI,
unmodified.

## Problem

Running several codex agents in parallel means juggling terminal windows by hand: no single
place to see every conversation, no visibility into which agent is blocked waiting for input,
no safe way to launch parallel agents in one checkout, and no way to jump back into an old
session from a global view. `codex resume`'s picker is per-invocation and cwd-scoped.

`codex-agents` derives a list of every codex thread (running, waiting, or finished) straight
from codex's own records, so every conversation shows up — not just ones launched from the
cockpit — with the threads that need your input surfaced at the top.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) installed and on `$PATH` — every cockpit-launched
  thread runs inside a detached tmux session
- A working `codex` CLI installation with state under `$CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`)

## Build / run

```sh
go build ./cmd/codex-agents
./codex-agents
```

or, without a separate build step:

```sh
go run ./cmd/codex-agents
```

Run it from the directory you want new threads launched into — the composer starts threads in
that directory (in a per-thread git worktree, if it's a git repo), while the list itself shows
threads across all projects. `$CODEX_HOME` is honored if set, otherwise `~/.codex` is used.

## Keybinds

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j` | Move selection |
| `enter` | Attach an alive thread's tmux session, or resume (`codex resume <id>`) and attach a closed one |
| `i` | Focus the composer to launch a new thread (`@` swaps profile, `enter` launches, `esc` cancels) |
| `r` | Quick-reply to the selected alive thread (`enter` sends, `esc` cancels); no-op on closed threads |
| `x` | Interrupt the selected thread's current turn (thread moves to **waiting**) |
| `a` | Archive: kill the tmux session, hide the thread from the list, and offer worktree removal (refuses if there's uncommitted or unpushed work) |
| `/` | Filter the list by title, repo, or branch |
| `?` | Toggle the help overlay |
| `q` / `ctrl+c` | Quit |

Detaching from an attached thread's tmux session (the usual tmux detach chord, e.g. `ctrl+b d`)
returns you to the cockpit with a refreshed list.

Threads move through three statuses, derived rather than self-reported: **working** (tmux
session alive, turn in progress) → **waiting** (tmux session alive, turn ended — needs you) →
**closed** (no tmux session). The list orders waiting → working → closed, most-recent first
within each group — ordering is the attention mechanism; there are no desktop notifications.

## Architecture

See [`docs/adr/0001-codex-agents-cockpit-architecture.md`](docs/adr/0001-codex-agents-cockpit-architecture.md)
for the full architectural contract (stack, read-only sqlite state source, tmux-per-thread
process model, worktree-per-thread launch semantics, status derivation) and measured results.
